# The following script installs all the -dev and -doc packages that should have
# been installed with your software but were omitted for some stupid reason.
#
# Tested on Linux Mint 13 but should work on any Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
# or really on any Debian derivative.
#
# If you get errors like A : Conflicts: B but C is to be installed
# then add those packages (all of the A) into the following list:
BADPKGLIST="libdb5.1 libglew1.5 libglew1.6 librdf0"

# List of all available packages
apt-cache pkgnames > /tmp/allpackages

NEWPKGLIST="build-essential"

  # Make sure it's not in the ignore list
